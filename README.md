# Indian-Sign-Language-Interpreter
Indian Sign Language (ISL) serves as a primary mode of communication for the deaf and hard of hearing community in India. Unfortunately, there is a significant gap between the number of individuals who use ISL and the availability of qualified interpreters. This disparity poses numerous challenges for the deaf community, hindering their access to education, healthcare, employment opportunities, and overall social inclusion. Recognizing the critical need to bridge this gap, the development and promotion of Indian Sign Language interpreters is of paramount importance.
